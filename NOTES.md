# Candidate notes

Add any notes here you'd like for reviewers to see in regard to your challenge submission.

## UXD Challenge completed by Nathan Renner

- Used SCSS instead of plain CSS.
- Imported all colors, border-radii, paddings, fonts & font weights, icons, and images from the Figma file to match as closely to the design component as possible.
- Used a mobile-first approach and added media query at the bottom of the stylesheet for larger screen sizes.
- Smaller screen sizes have a more centered view of the card contents, where larger sizes spread out to mock the design in the Figma file.
- Added a script at the bottom of the HTML document to load and display the lower-quality "avatar-naomi.png" image while the larger "avatar-naomi@2x.png" image loads. I added comments in the code that explain my thought-process.

### Thank you again for this opportunity!
